# Project-A
/xirl - using open source Xmagical RL code from XIRL group.
this code is for trainig different embodyments, icluding a robot gripper to preform simple tasks such as putting a object in it's request place.
we added an embodiment, HAND which will learn the movements of a surgical hand.
for training we used medical data containing videos of surgery cuts being preformed. 
/sim - contins a basic html simulation to present the data points of the hand, preforimg the opertaion they learnt from the data it was trained on.
